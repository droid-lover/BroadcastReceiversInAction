# BroadcastReceiversInAction
Little bit about catching the broadcast :) 
Well *Broadcast Receivers* simply respond to broadcast messages from other applications or from the system itself. 
These messages are sometime called events or intents. 

There are following two important steps to make BroadcastReceiver works for the system broadcasted intents âˆ’

1.) Creating the Broadcast Receiver.

2.) Registering Broadcast Receiver


1.) Creating the Broadcast Receiver.
A broadcast receiver is implemented as a subclass of BroadcastReceiver class and overriding the onReceive() method where each message is received as a Intent object parameter.

/**
 * Created by sachin .
 */

public class MyGlobalReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {


    @RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN)
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        Log.d("Event", "Coming here of my Action" + intent);

        Log.d("Event", "Action is " + intent.getAction());

        if (intent.getAction() == "android.intent.action.ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED") {
            Toast.makeText(context, "POWER_CONNECTED.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            //Here we can do our work after we get this event action here

        } else {

        }
    }
}

2.) Registering Broadcast Receiver

An application listens for specific broadcast intents by registering a broadcast receiver in AndroidManifest.xml file. 

*Broadcasting Custom Intents*


                Intent customActionIntent = new Intent();
                customActionIntent.setAction("CUSTOM_ACTION");
                sendBroadcast(customActionIntent);
